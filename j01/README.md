# First Journal Entry...
   I live 30 minutes away from campus. Because of that, I'm on the road almost every single day throughout the year. Driving in different weather conditions means I have to use different settings on my trucks a/c unit to have a safe drive to school.

   The interface is very simple and easy to learn, a dial that sets the temperature, a dial that sets the strength of the current, and a dial that sets where the air comes out of. It also has two buttons, one that turns on the air conditioning system(button w/ snowflake), and one that recirculates the air inside the vehicle. Each button has a light that when pressed, lights up to signal that it's on. 

   The buttons, while simple, relies on the driver knowing what the buttons do and knowing they need to press them. Midway through this last summer, I finally learned that to turn on my a/c I had to turn the dial to cold AND press the button for air conditioning. This was after driving in 100+ degree weather and thinking my a/c was broken for months. I found out the buttons use when I flipped open the manual boxlet to the section about the a/c.

   Once learning of this, I thought it was a weird design decision to have to twist a dial for cold air and press another button that offically turns on the a/c. I feel like the easiest way to address this issue to improve efficiency is to just have the dial and by twisting it to cold, got you cold air.
